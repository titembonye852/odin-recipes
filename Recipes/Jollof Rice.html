        <h3>Steps for making Jollof Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or <br>
                blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well</li>
                <p></p>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high. Once the oil is <br>
                heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden<br>
                 brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste <br>
                 and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about <br>
                 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste<br> 
                 for about 30 minutes Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture <br> does not burn.</li>
                 <p></p>
                 <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix<br>
                 and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and <br>
                 the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
                 <p></p>
                 <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew.<br>
                 At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with <br>
                 the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, <br>
                 cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
                 <p></p>
                 <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew,<br>
                 cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid<br>
                  has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your <br>
                  Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
